# Pi scripts, configs, files, etc.

### [boot](boot/)

This directory contains files to configure the Pi's display, WiFi, and SSH.

Copy all files to the boot partion, **except** those marked 'no copy' or 'sample'.

### [openauto](openauto/)

This directory contains my OpenAuto configuration files.

Information regarding OpenAuto system configuration can be found [here](https://bluewavestudio.io/community/thread-2042.html).

[openauto_license.dat.SAMPLE](OpenAuto/openauto_license.dat.SAMPLE) is an example file. To use it, the contents should be replaced with your key and the file should be renamed to not include `.SAMPLE`.

### [scripts](scripts/)

This directory contains scripts to be copied to the Pi, once the OS has been installed.

### [splash-animation](splash-animation/)

This directory contains the original splash animation and my custom one.

See more info in [splash-animation/README.md](splash-animation/README.md).
